# Architecture

Confirmed product and system facts for this project. Decisions only — no open questions or lessons learned (those belong in KNOWLEDGE.md).

## Product scope
- Personal tool that turns selected X (Twitter) users' output into clean, filterable, inbox-friendly weekly newsletters, so the owner can log off X without losing high-value signal.
- Product name in the UI: **Mentally Stable X Experience**. Do not use the word "digest" anywhere in the codebase.
- "Inbox-friendly" does not mean email. Email is out of scope.
- Single user for now (the owner). May become a sellable product later; no multi-tenant work yet.
- Accessed via a webpage on the owner's VPS, as a subdomain of the owner's personal domain.
- Owner can add and remove X accounts.
- One weekly newsletter edition per account per week (stored in the `editions` table).
- Per-account granular settings (e.g. include/exclude quote tweets). Settings affect which API calls are made (fetch layer), not just newsletter rendering.
- Per-account visibility into X API cost incurred by that account, computed from rows in the `api_calls` table (no log files).
- Before adding a new account, **Estimate cost** on the add card calls X `GET /2/tweets/counts/all` three times (one per complete Mon–Mon week, oldest to newest) at ~$0.01/request (~$0.03 total). The app averages those tweet counts and projects weekly fetch cost as `avg_tweets × $0.005 + $0.01` user lookup, using default new-account settings (replies and retweets excluded at the API; quotes always counted). Rejects handles already tracked. Does not write to `api_calls`.
- Homepage: horizontally scrollable carousel of newsletter cards (one per account). Each card shows settings toggles, API cost, and the latest newsletter inline — no separate account list or detail page. On load, missing newsletters are built from stored tweets when the current week has tweets but no edition row (no X API calls).
- Links out to X (profile, tweet, quoted author, video media) and the per-account RSS feed open in a new browser tab (`target="_blank"` with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`). In-app navigation (home, Settings, sign-in) stays in the same tab.
- Per-tweet mark-read control is a minimal checkmark (no checkbox, no label). Stores the tweet id in `read_tweets`. Read tweets stay visible, dimmed, and sort to the bottom of that newsletter (unread first, chronological within each group). Click again to unread.
- Per-newsletter mark-read control is the same minimal checkmark at the bottom of every account card (including empty weeks and accounts with no edition yet). Stored in `read_newsletters` as `(account_id, week_start)`. That account's card is removed for that week; a later week's edition shows again.
- Toolbar settings toggles, tweet mark-read, and newsletter mark-read save via `fetch` + JSON (Accept: application/json). They must not full-page POST/redirect — that reloaded `/` and reset the carousel to the leftmost card.
- Long posts: weekly fetch requests X `note_tweet` so full text is stored (without it, API `text` is truncated ~280 chars). Very long text is shown collapsed to 8 lines with a More/Less control.
- Settings page at `/settings`: list tracked accounts with remove actions; shows active account count and total API cost for the current calendar month (UTC, sum of `api_calls.cost_usd`). Linked from a Settings button in the site header (left of Sign out).
- Account lists (homepage carousel and settings) sort by handle case-insensitively (`ORDER BY handle COLLATE NOCASE`) so mixed-case handles do not sort ahead of lowercase ones.
- Favicon at `/static/favicon.svg` (teal tile with a checkmark), linked from the base template.
- Carousel navigation: mouse wheel over card chrome or gaps scrolls horizontally between cards; wheel over the newsletter body scrolls vertically inside that card. Left/right arrow keys move between cards; up/down arrow keys scroll inside the centered card. Card bodies and the carousel hide scrollbars.
- RSS feed structure is not finalized (per-account vs consolidated recap). v1 ships per-account feeds at `/feeds/{id}.xml` as the baseline.

## Tech stack
- Backend: Python + FastAPI — one app serves web pages, RSS, and the weekly fetch.
- Database: SQLite (single file). Path from `DATABASE_PATH` in `.env` (or the process environment on the VPS). Default: `~/.local/share/newsletter-tool/newsletter.db` — outside the repo so git worktrees share one database. Raw API responses cached in the DB so newsletters can be rebuilt without refetching.
- Frontend: server-rendered Jinja2 templates; `app/static/carousel.js` for carousel drag-scroll, spatial wheel zones, and arrow-key navigation. No JS framework, no build step.
- Scheduling: APScheduler inside the app (weekly fetch, Monday 06:00 UTC). Can be reduced to cron later.
- Hosting: owner's VPS.

## X API (confirmed 2026-07)
- Pay-per-use credits in the Developer Console; legacy subscription tiers are deprecated for new developers.
- Approximate unit costs: $0.005 per post read, $0.010 per user read. Post reads capped at 2M/month.
- Same resource requested twice within 24 hours is charged once (X deduplication).
- **App credentials (server):** `X_BEARER_TOKEN` — used by the weekly fetch job and other read-only API calls that act as the app, not as a logged-in user.
- **User OAuth 2.0 (browser):** `X_CLIENT_ID`, `X_CLIENT_SECRET`, `X_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET` — OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE. All web routes except `/auth/*` require a signed-in X user session. Scopes at sign-in: `users.read`, `tweet.read`, `like.write`, `follows.write`, `offline.access`. Optional `X_OAUTH_SCOPES` overrides that list. Bearer-token fetch and scheduling do not use the user session.
- **Owner actions on X:** Adding a tracked account triggers a follow from the signed-in owner account (POST follow; no pre-check of the following list). After each weekly newsletter is built, tweets that made it into the edition are queued and a background thread drains the queue: first like immediately, then ~1 minute ± 1–20s between each until done. OAuth tokens persist in `oauth_session` (refreshed while draining). Already-liked tweet IDs are stored in `liked_tweets`; pending likes live in `like_queue`. On app startup, a non-empty queue resumes draining.
- **Tweet media:** Weekly fetch requests `attachments.media_keys` and `referenced_tweets.id` expansions (quoted posts bill as extra post reads). Expanded media is stored on each tweet's `raw_json`; quote tweets also store `quoted_tweet` with its media. Newsletter items include `media` and optional `quoted` blocks. Photos render inline via `pbs.twimg.com` URLs; videos and GIFs show a preview thumbnail linking to the tweet on X. Media-related `t.co` short links are stripped from displayed text at build time. Post-read units recorded in `api_calls` count timeline tweets plus any expanded referenced tweets (unique IDs per response page).

## System layout
Single repo, single FastAPI app:
1. **Fetch** (`app/fetch/`) — X API v2 client. Per-account settings gate which calls run. Every request writes to `api_calls` (endpoint, units, estimated cost).
2. **Storage** (`app/db.py`) — SQLite schema and queries for accounts, tweets, editions, api_calls.
3. **Newsletter builder** (`app/newsletter.py`) — pure logic: stored tweets + settings → newsletter items. Also filters at build time so settings changes reshape newsletters without refetching.
4. **Web** (`app/main.py`, `app/templates/`) — homepage carousel, per-card settings, edition pages (for RSS deep links), RSS (`app/rss.py`). RSS never hits the X API.
5. **Scheduler** (`app/scheduler.py`) — APScheduler weekly job; also runnable manually via `run_job()`.

## Run locally
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
cp .env.example .env   # set X_BEARER_TOKEN and OAuth vars (see .env.example)
source venv/bin/activate
news-dev
pytest
```

## Deploy (VPS)
App runs as a single uvicorn process. Set `X_BEARER_TOKEN`, OAuth vars, and `DATABASE_PATH` (e.g. `/var/lib/newsletter-tool/newsletter.db`) in the environment; register the production callback URL in the X Developer Console (`https://your-subdomain.example.com/auth/callback`); reverse-proxy the subdomain to the app port.
